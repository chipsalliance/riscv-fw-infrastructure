/* This structure is defined and used INTERNALLY (i.e. it is not exposed in the api) to calculate the overall size of the mutexs-heap.
 * In the mutexs-heap there are two consecutive parts - in the 1'st one there is a series of mutexs (32bit each).
 * In the 2'nd section there is a series of pspMutexMngmng structures. Each such structure indicates (1) whether the associated mutex is 'occupied'
 * (i.e. created by the application and is in use) or 'unoccupied' (i.e. destroyed by the application or haven't been created at all)
 * and (2) in case it was created, which hart created the mutex.
 * Note that the mutexs heap is not organized as a series of pspMutexCb_t structures. Instead, first there are the N dwords (32bits) for N mutexs (these are
 * the uiMutexState fields) and then there are N pspMutexMngmnt_t structures (8bits) as management information for N mutexs.
 * So, the overall size of the heap is N * sizeof(pspMutexCb_t)
