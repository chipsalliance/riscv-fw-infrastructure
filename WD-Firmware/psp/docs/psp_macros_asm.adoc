= psp_macros_asm
The file defines PSP macros that are used in Assembly code. These macros depend
on the core definition of 32/64 bits.

== Macros
===  XLEN dependent macros
|==================================================
| *Definition* | *Comment* 
| M_PSP_STORE operand1,operand2 | Store to the memory defined by operand2
the value of operand1.
| M_PSP_LOAD operand1,operand2 | Load a byte from memory defined by
operand2 to register operand1.
| M_PSP_ADDI operand1,operand2,operand3 | Add sign-extended immediate defined by
operand3 to the value of register operand2 and write the result to the register
operand1.
|==================================================

=== Handling bytes and half words
|==================================================
| *Definition* | *Comment* 
| M_PSP_STORE_BYTE operand1,operand2 | Store to the memory defined by operand2
the value of operand1.
| M_PSP_LOAD_BYTE operand1,operand2 | Load a byte from memory defined by
operand2 to register operand1.
| M_PSP_STORE_HALF operand1,operand2 | Store the two least-significant bytes in
register operand1 to memory defined by operand2.
| M_PSP_LOAD_HALF operand1,operand2 | Load two bytes from memory defined by
operand2 and write them to operand1 register.
|==================================================

=== Interrupt handler and push/pop registers
To use ISR stack one should define it's size by providig a non-zero value for
D_ISR_STACK_SIZE while building the PSP. The current implementation uses the
same stack for both applicatons and ISRs. 
|==================================================
| *Definition* | *Comment* 
| M_PSP_CALL_INT_HANDLER fptIntHandler | Macro for calling interrupt handler.
| M_PSP_PUSH_REGFILE | Macro for saving application context.
| M_PSP_POP_REGFILE | Macro for restoring application context.
| M_PSP_CHANGE_SP_FROM_APP_TO_ISR_STACK | Macro for setting SP to use stack
dedicated to ISRs. It loads the sp register with the address of the current
Task-CB.
| M_PSP_CHANGE_SP_FROM_ISR_TO_APP_STACK | Macro for setting SP to use a stack of
the current application.
| M_PSP_MACHINE_DISABLE_INTERRUPTS | Macro for disabling machine interrupts
after reading the current status. Available in MACHINE mode only.
| M_PSP_MACHINE_RESTORE_INTERRUPTS | Macro for restoring machine interrupts
status. Available in MACHINE mode only.
