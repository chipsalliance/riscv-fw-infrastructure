=== pspMachineInternalTimerSetup64bitTimer
Cascade Timer0 and Timer1 to act as a single timer. In this mode, Timer1 counts
up when Timer0 reaches its bound value. Timer1 interrupt raises when Timer1
reaches its bound. **Note:** In the 'cascade' mode, HALT-EN and PAUSE-EN
indications must be set identically for both timers, so part of this function
also set disable all of them here.
