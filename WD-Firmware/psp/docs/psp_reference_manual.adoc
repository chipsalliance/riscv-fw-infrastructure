== Overview
This reference document provides a summary of APIs for RISC-V processors
supported by Western Digital. It includes the SweRV family of cores EH1, EL2,
EH2. One can find more information about SweRV cores on
https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-SweRV[chipsalliance github].


=== Usage and Compilation Flags
Including psp_api.h per complication unit is sufficient enough for integrating
all the PSP services per core. psp_api.h is divided into core sections,
encapsulated in compile switches to enable all supported features for a given
core:
[#CompilerFlags]
|========================================================================
| *Compiler Flags* | *Core* | *Comment*
| D_SWERV_EH1 | SweRV EH1 |
| D_SWERV_EH1 D_SWERV_EL2 | SweRV EL2 |
| D_SWERV_EH1 D_SWERV_EL2 D_SWERV_EH2 | SweRV EH2 |
| D_BIT_MANIPULATION | SweRV EL2, SweRV_EH2 |
| D_DCCM_SECTION_START_ADDRESS | SweRV_EH2 | The flag is required to support
compiler build-in atomic operations.
| D_NUMBER_OF_HARTS | all SweRV cores | the defaul value is 1
|========================================================================
This document is a reference manual for developers interested in writing
applications for SweRV processors.

The document is organized as follows:

* <<Conventions>> section elaborates on conventions used in this PSP
reference manual.
* <<Common>> includes definitions common for all the cores (e.g., type
definitions).
* <<Compiler Manual>> includes compiler specific definitions.
* <<Features>>, the main section of this reference, includes supported features
divided into groups per core.


=== Conventions
File names are aligned to the feature names and follow the pattern
[source, c]
----
psp_<feature>_<core>
----
Throughout the reference, we keep section (feature) structure such that every
subsection corresponds to a specific core.

Code within source and header files follows WD-Firmware
xref:{include_dir}/../../coding_convention.adoc[coding convention].

== Features
This section lists services supported by the cores.

=== psp_macros
The subsection <<psp_macros_ref, psp_macros>> includes general macros as defined
by RISC-V spec (unprivileged and privileged, see
<<ReferenceDocuments, Reference Documents>> table).
<<psp_macros_eh2_ref, EH2>> subsection adds SweRV specific macros.

include::{include_dir}/psp_macros.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_macros_eh2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_macros_asm
<<psp_macros_asm_ref, psp_macros_asm>> subsection is relevant for all platforms. 
<<psp_macros_asm_eh1_ref, EH1>> subsection adds SweRV specific macros.

include::{include_dir}/psp_macros_asm.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_macros_asm_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_csrs
The subsection <<psp_csrs_ref, psp_csrs>> defines CSRs according to RISC-V
privileged specification version 1.10
(see <<ReferenceDocuments, Reference Documents>> table). <<psp_csrs_eh1_ref, EH1>>,
<<psp_csrs_el2_ref, EL2>> and <<psp_csrs_eh2_ref, EH2>> subsections add SweRV
specific macros per core version.

include::{include_dir}/psp_csrs.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_csrs_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_csrs_el2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_csrs_eh2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_corr_err_cnt
This section contains an API for counters of miscellaneous correctable-errors
that occurs in the system. For the correctable-error-counters feature to work,
the user should register ISR for E_MACHINE_CORRECTABLE_ERROR_CAUSE interrupt.

All SweRV cores support this feature.

include::{include_dir}/psp_corr_err_cnt_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_cache_control
The feature is supported on all SweRV cores. It allows to mark memory regions as
cacheable and specify whether the memory access has side effects.

include::{include_dir}/psp_cache_control_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_performance_monitor
Performance monitoring API defines a set of counter registers and events that
trigger the counters increment, along with functions to enable/disable access
them. For more information refer to the PRMs (see
<<ReferenceDocuments, Reference Documents>> table).

Each subsection corresponds to a specific SweRV core.

include::{include_dir}/psp_performance_monitor_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_performance_monitor_el2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_pmc
The Power Management Control (PMC) section describes the PMC services that
firmware can use to control the core power functionality.

These functions are supported for all the cores.

include::{include_dir}/psp_pmc_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_interrupts
The <<psp_interrupts_ref, psp_interrupts>> subseciton lists interrupt/exception
causes as defined by privileged spec. ver. 1.10. It provides functionality to
manipulate ISRs and exception handlers, which are relevant for all the cores.
The subsection <<psp_interrupts_eh1_ref, psp_interrupts_eh1>> extends the API
for SweRV core.

Functions prefixed with pspMachine/pspUser should be called from the
corresponding modes (Machine/User).

include::{include_dir}/psp_interrupts.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_interrupts_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_ext_interrupts
This section provides an API for registering, configuring and handling external
interrupts.

EL2 and EH1 cores use the same API defined in
<<psp_ext_interrupts_eh1_ref, psp_ext_interrupts_eh1>>. EH2 having two harts,
requires additional APIs to delegate an external interrupt to a specific hart,
which is defined in <<psp_ext_interrupts_eh2_ref, psp_ext_interrupts_eh2>>.

include::{include_dir}/psp_ext_interrupts_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_ext_interrupts_eh2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_nmi
<<psp_nmi_eh1_ref, EH1 subsection>> of NMIs (Non-Maskable Interrupts) provides
basic NMI functionality. <<psp_nmi_el2_ref, EL2>> adds error-value definitions
for fast interrupts. Finally, <<psp_nmi_eh2_ref, EH2>> section extands this
functionality further to support multiple (2) harts.

include::{include_dir}/psp_nmi_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_nmi_el2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_nmi_eh2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_int_vect
API defined in <<psp_int_vect_ref, psp_int_vect>> is relevant for all single
core IPs (i.e. EH1, EL2). It is extanded in
<<psp_int_vect_eh2_ref, psp_int_vect_eh2>> to support dual-hard cores (EH2). 

Assign the vector-table address to _mtvec_ CSR (Machine trap-handler base
address) once the program is ready to deal with an assertion of
exception/interrupt.

include::{include_dir}/psp_int_vect.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_int_vect_eh2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_timers
Each of the cores EH1/EL2/EH2 has two internal timers and one machine timer. 
Few differences:

* An internal timer is a hardware timer inside a core, while the machine timer
is a platform timer.
* Internal timers can be pauses on HALT mode. Machine timer can not do that.
This feature is suitable for Software debugging on RTOS-based systems since RTOS
ticks can be stopped on debugging.
* EL2 and EH2 can cascade internal timers 1 and 2 to a single 64-bit timer.

In EH1/EL2/EH2 cores there is a capability to determine whether the internal
timers continue to tick even when the core is in sleep/halt mode.

The subsection <<psp_timers_ref, psp_timers>> provides API support on all
cores. <<psp_timers_eh1_ref, psp_timers_eh1>> adds functionality to the SweRV
cores. Finally, <<psp_timers_el2_ref, psp_timers_el2>> content is supported only
on the second generation of SweRV cores (EL2, EH2).

include::{include_dir}/psp_timers.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_timers_eh1.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::{include_dir}/psp_timers_el2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_atomics
This section describes atomic operations as defined in the standard RISC-V 
Atomic (A) extension.

It is only supported on EH2.

include::{include_dir}/psp_atomics_eh2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_mutex
PSP Mutex provides mutual exclusion services for multi-hurt (HW threading) based
systems, e.g. EH2. Mutual exclusion pertains to controlling the access of HW
threads to certain hart. The API's use the Atomic operation do handle mutual
exclusion.

It is only supported on EH2.

include::{include_dir}/psp_mutex_eh2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


=== psp_bitmanip
Support of bit manipulations exists for the second generation of SweRV cores
(EL2, EH2).

include::{include_dir}/psp_bitmanip_el2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
